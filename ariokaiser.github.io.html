			Welcome to MedievalMC, a medieval towny and survival experience. Here you can build with friends to form towns and nations to eventually conquer the world. To join simply use the server address Medieval-MC.com. The map you play on in the server is of Europe. Gold is the currency of the server, gold blocks, ignots, and nuggets are all accepted currency with each having its own value. The server uses the conquest resourcepack, which comes with unique weapons and armor that players, towns, and nations can use to represent themselves (the version used on the server has been edited).
